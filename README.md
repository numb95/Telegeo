### *Still under development*

use pipenv to install dependencies. Google it. open your shell config and add you token to a BOT_TOKEN enviroment variable. For example you can add ```export BOT_TOKEN='TOKEN'``` to your shell config. 

it's just recieve your location and send you the google map address. Will add what is going on near you.
